In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).  Specifically, strong reference cycles can easily occur, leading to memory leaks. Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) AnotherClass *anotherObject;
@end

@interface AnotherClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) MyClass *myObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
// ...
@end

@implementation AnotherClass
// ...
@end
```

If `MyClass` holds a strong reference to `AnotherClass` and vice-versa, neither object will be deallocated even when they're no longer needed. This is because each object keeps the other alive.  This is a classic strong reference cycle.
